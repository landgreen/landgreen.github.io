			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=400xfGmSlqQ">Cloud chambers</a> are a simple method of detecting high energy particles. Inside the
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyKZlFPYNAg">chamber</a> is a a supersaturated vapor of water or alcohol. High speed particles disrupt the vapor and leave a trail.</p>

		<p>When a powerful magnetic field is applied to the cloud chamber the charged particles curve. The arc of their curve indicates
			charge and mass.</p>

		<div class='example'>
			<strong>Question:</strong> The magnetic field causes most of the particles to move in a circular arc, yet some particles still
			move in a straight line. What properties coudl cause a particle to curve or not curve in a magnetic field?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				<br> Charged particles like electrons and positrons follow curved paths. Neutrally charged particles ignore the magnetic
				field, but they aren't visible in a cloud cloud-chamber.
				<br>
				<br>The particles moving in a straight line are charged, but they are so massive their curve isn't noticeable.

			<h1 class='underlined'>Magnetic Fields</h1>
			<p>Magnetic fields are an addition to electric fields that accounts for Einstein's theory of
				<a href="../../relativity/special/index.html#specialrelativity">special relativity</a>. Like electric fields, magnetic fields are produced by charged particles, but only when the charged
				particle is moving. A magnetic field applies a force on a moving charged particle.
				<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TKSfAkWWN0'>Watch Veritasium explain</a>.</p>

			<p class='definition'>Moving charges produce magnetic fields.</p>
			<p>Electric current is a source of moving charges. Electric current in a straight wire produces a magnetic field that curves
				around the wire.</p>
			<p>The
				<strong>right hand rule</strong> can be used to find the direction the field turns. Place your right hand's thumb in the direction
				of the current. Your finger will curl in the direction the field turns.</p>

			<p>Current moving in a ring shape has the same magnetic field as a permanent magnet. The magnetic field from permanent magnets
				comes from spinning charges.</p>

			<p class='definition'>Spinning charges produce magnetic fields.</p>
			<p>Electrons spin. Normally the electrons in atoms spin in opposing directions, but in ferromagnetic materials some spins
				remain unbalanced. The unbalanced spinning electrons produce a net magnetic field.
				<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM'>Watch Minute Physics explain</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Permanent magnets</strong> always have unbalanced spins.
				<br>Example: a refrigerator magnet.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Paramagnetic magnets</strong> only have unbalanced spins when exposed to a magnetic field.
				<br>Example: the refrigerator door, paper clips hanging from a magnet.</p>

			<p>We also have strong evidence that the North and South poles experience periodic

				The reversals are unpredictable, but generally there is several thousand years of stability between flips.</p>
			<p>The Earth's magnetic field slows down charged particles. This shields the Earth from the solar wind's ionizing radiation.
				This slowing down can be seen at the north and south poles as an

						<strong>Example:</strong> The Earth's magnetic field protects us from solar wind. What is the radius for the circular motion
						of an electron in the Earth's magnetic field? Wikipedia says that the field is up to 70μT, and particles from the solar
						wind travel at up to 500 km/s.
						<details>
							<summary>solution</summary>
							$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$ $$r = \frac{(9.1 \times 10^{-31})(500,000)}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(70 \times 10^{-6})}$$ $$r = 0.0406
							m $$
						</details>
					</div>

					<div class='example'>

						<strong>Example:</strong> Find the radius for a proton in the same conditions.
						<details>
							<summary>solution</summary>
							$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$ $$r = \frac{(1.67 \times 10^{-27})(500,000)}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(70 \times 10^{-6})}$$ $$r = 74.55

						<strong>Example:</strong> Find the radius of the circular path of an electron moving at 111m/s in a 2T magnetic field.
						<details>
							<summary>solution</summary>
							$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$ $$r = \frac{(9.1 \times 10^{-31})(111)}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(2)}$$ $$r = 3.1 \times 10^{-10}m $$
						</details>
					</div>
					<div class='example'>
						<strong>Example:</strong> You fire a 1kg object charged with +1C at 1m/s. The object arcs into a circle with a radius of 1m.
						What magnetic field could have produced this arc.
						<details>
							<summary>solution</summary>
							$$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$$ $$B = \frac{mv}{qr}$$ $$B = \frac{(1)(1)}{(1)(1)}$$ $$B = 1 T$$

					<h2 class='underlined'>Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
					<h2 class='definition'>Electromagnetic
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sENgdSF8ppA">induction</a> is the production of voltage from a conductor moving past a magnetic field. </h2>
					<p>The process is used to make voltage from motion with a generator.
						<br>Example: Nuclear, coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, and wind power
						<p>Electromagnetic induction in reverse turns voltage into motion.
							<br>Example: electric motors in cars, fans, blenders, clocks, air conditioners</p>

						<p>You can see a simulation of induction in the Phet simulation below.</p>
