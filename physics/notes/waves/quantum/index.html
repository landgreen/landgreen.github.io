      In the early 1900s physicists performed experiments that probed reality at its fundamental level.
      They found that matter was made of particles called atoms.
      Inside each atom they found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehHoOYqAT_U">subatomic particles</a>: electrons, protons, and neutrons.
      They also found that light was made of particles that we now call photons.
      <!-- Light waves are too big to resolve objects that small. -->
      <!-- Instead, physicists <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/rutherford-scattering/latest/rutherford-scattering_en.html">fired</a> subatomic particles, like electrons, at each other. -->
      <!-- They were also surprised to discover that particles could produce wave-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment">interference patterns</a>. -->
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangest result was that these particles produced wave-like <a href="http://toutestquantique.fr/en/duality/">interference patterns</a>.
      <strong>The separate wave and particle models weren't accurate.</strong>

    <details class="derive">
      <summary>the particle model vs. the wave model</summary>
      <p>
        Particles are one of the basic models used by physics to simplify approximations.
        Particles have a position in space and time, but they don't have any internal structure.
        They have a mass and velocity, and they can collide like <a href="../../motion/motion/index.html">billiard balls</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The particle model approximates phenomena like:
        collisions, temperature, pressure, friction, electricity, diffusion, and chemical reactions.
        <!-- The particle model is applied to things like: photons, electrons, protons, atoms, molecules, cells, dust, sand, tennis balls, and stars. -->
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The wave model approximates how energy spreads through a medium.
        For example, a sound wave propagates through air when atoms collide.
        The wave model also applies to unexpected media, like traffic waves for cars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waves are used to approximate phenomena like:
        color, diffraction, interference patterns, doppler shifting, standing waves, reflection, and refraction.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <li><strong>Particles</strong> are located at a single position.</li>
        <li><strong>Waves</strong> are spread out with negative and positive amplitudes.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Particles</strong> move in a single direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Waves</strong> propagate in all possible directions.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Particles</strong> bounce off each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Waves</strong> don't interact with each other, but when they are in superposition they interfere constructively and destructively.</li>

        The overlap between the wave and particle models at the nanometer scale led to many more exciting experiments.
        Over time, physicists developed and refined a new model, called <strong>quantum mechanics</strong>.
        Predictions based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjZXqdUZDZA">quantum mechanics</a> can only give probabilities,
        but when applied to repeated experiments they have an unparalleled level of accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        An understanding of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNCGaVGuGfKfJl-6RdHiCjo1">quantum mechanics</a> is typically achieved after studying the underlying math.
        Building an intuition without the math can be <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">confusing</a>,
        but here is a brief and inevitably flawed description.
      </p>
      <details class="derive">
        <summary>how quantum mechanics makes predictions</summary>
        <p>
          The state of a quantum mechanical system is described mathematically by it's <strong>wave function</strong>.
          The wave function contains all the measurable information about the system.
          The evolution of the wave function over time can be calculated for simple situations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- A particle's wave function also represents a superposition of all possible states for the particle.
          When a particle interacts with something, it's wave function will be measured in one of those possible states. -->
          The probability of measuring a system in a particular state is a separate calculation.
          It is done by adding the positive and negative amplitudes of every <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSFRN-ymfgE">possible</a> state the system's wave function could have.
          This produces a <a href="..\waveproperties\index.html#interference">superposition</a> of the possible states.
          When squared, the amplitude of that superposition predicts the probabilities of measuring the system in each possible <a href="http://toutestquantique.fr/en/superposition/">state</a>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          In order to measure the results of an experiment, an observer must interact with the experiment.
          Interacting is complex because everything is a quantum object, including the observer and the experiment.
          This means that the wave function of the observer interacts with the wave function of the experiment.
          The observer and experiment together form a superposition of all possible outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The observer can't directly see this superposition, like how sound waves in superposition can't directly effect each other.
          The observer only experiences one experimental outcome chosen at random.
          Why can't they see all the outcomes?
          The answer to that question depends on how you interpret quantum mechanics.

        <summary>interpretations of quantum mechanics</summary>
        <p>
          Different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics">interpretations</a>
          of quantum mechanics suggest suggest strange and exciting things about the fundamental nature of our reality.
          Yet, each interpretation is just a different way to put math into words.
        </p>
        <p>
          All valid interpretations of quantum mechanics should predict the same experimental outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2 class='underlined-small'>The Many-Worlds Interpretations</h2>
        <p>
          If the mathematics of quantum mechanics is interpreted literally,
          it means that every possible outcome of an interaction actually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzKWfw68M5U">occurs</a>.
          These possible outcomes interfere with each other in a way that effects the probability of which outcomes are actually observed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right after an interaction the different outcomes haven't diverged from each other, so they are in similar phases of their wave cycle.
          Being in similar phases allows constructive and destructive interference patterns to form.
          Outcomes get out of phase with each other after interacting with different aspects of the environment.
          Being out of phase disrupts the constructive and destructive interference patterns.
          We say that the outcomes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlOwJWJWPUs">decohere</a> from each other after interacting with the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="../waveproperties/index.html#standing-wave-sim">Standing waves</a> work in a similar way.
          Waves form constructive and destructive patterns when the wavelength of reflections match the size of the space they are in.
          When the space doesn't match the wavelength, the reflections just add up to background noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The many-worlds interpretation suggests that a version of you exists that observes each possible outcome of a quantum event.
          You can't interact with those other versions because their phase is out of sync with your phase.
          No one has devised an experiment to test for these branching worlds. For now their existence is unknowable.
        </p>

        <h2 class='underlined-small'>The Copenhagen Interpretation</h2>
        <p>
          The Copenhagen interpretation was the first popular explanation of the math behind quantum mechanics.
          It says that particles have no precise position or momentum.
          They are just a waves of probability.
          Yet, after interacting with another particle they collapse into a single outcome chosen at random.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Copenhagen interpretation calculates the wave function by adding the amplitudes of every possible outcome.
          It diverges from the many-worlds interpretation by randomly choosing just one possible outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unchosen outcomes are said to be collapsed.
          Collapsing the wave function down to one outcome allows us to remove the extra worlds at the cost of an extra step.
        </p>

        <h2 class='underlined-small'>Pilot Wave Theory</h2>
        <p>
          This interpretation is in some ways the closest to classical physics.
          Particles are real, and there is only one reality, but there is also a wave function that determines how a particle moves.
          A particle's trajectory is guided away from regions where the wave function's interference is destructive and towards regions of constructive interference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other interpretations, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlXdsyctD50">pilot wave theory</a> allows us to view particles as real things.
          The downside is that we also have to accept a hidden layer of reality that guides particles, but isn't directly observable.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
          The Copenhagen interpretation sounds less exciting, but it's still very strange.
          After two particles interact, they become entangled.
          Entangled particles will both collapse when either one is measured.
          Additionally, the collapsed states have random, but matching properties, as if they are in communication.
          This collapse can occur instantly at any distance, but it doesn't allow meaningful information to travel faster than light.

        <p>
          Is reality made of particles that act like waves, or waves that act like particles?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes reality acts like a wave or particle, but fundamentally reality is its own thing.

          Before quantum mechanics, physicists thought light was waves and atoms were particles.
          This dual view arose because of differences in how light and atoms interact.
          Atoms push other atoms away. This interaction makes their wave nature more fleeting.
          Photons of light don't normally interact with each other, so they maintain their wave nature more predictably.

          In particle physics, things that take up space are called <strong>fermions</strong>.
          This includes atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, and most molecules.
          Things that can be stacked up in the same location are called <strong>bosons</strong>.
          This includes force carrier particles like light.
          The reason for this differences in interaction has to do with a property called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1S6KfMzOH8">spin</a>.

        <p>
          An advanced version of quantum mechanics, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATcrrzJFtBY&t=747s">quantum field theory</a> has a wave-centric view.
          In this theory there is a field for each type of fundamental particle that is spread out across all of space and time.
          Each individual particle is viewed as a localized excited state of its underlying field.
          For example, a single electron is an excited state of the electron field.
          The electron field exists everywhere, but electrons are more likely to be measured in areas that are excited.

          Small particles, like atoms, have a measurable wave nature.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjaAxUO6-Uw">Cats</a> are made of atoms.
          Why don't we notice cats acting like waves?
        </p>
        <p>
          1.
          Atoms are hard to isolate.
          They are frequently interacting with their surroundings.
          For large groups of atoms this happens so frequently that measurable wave interference patterns don't have time to develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.
          A particle's wavelength decreases as mass increases.
          Cats are much bigger then atoms, so they have a very short wavelength.
          The wavelength of human scale objects is so short they can't be measured by current technology.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          A <a href="http://toutestquantique.fr/en/bose-einstein-condensate/">Bose-Einstein condensate</a>
          is one way to produce particles in superposition at the macroscopic scale.
          They are made by cooling a class of particles to near absolute zero.
          Cold particles move slower, and according to quantum mechanics slower particles have longer wavelengths.
          As the temperature lowers, the wave functions of the particles begin to overlap.
          This causes them to enter a shared quantum state.
          A group of particles in this shared state behave as if they had a single wave function.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Quantum mechanics is currently the most accurate theory for how our universe works, but it is still limited.
          Quantum mechanics doesn't explain large scale phenomena, like gravitation, dark matter, or dark energy.
          New theories that unite gravity with quantum mechanics are being developed, but so far nothing testable has emerged.

    <h2 class='underlined'>Photon Energy</h2>
    <p>
      In 1899, after investigating the <a href="..\light\index.html#thermal">thermal radiation</a> spectrum,
      Maxwell Planck reluctantly hypothesized that the energy of light is only released in small quantities determined by its frequency.
      This idea was the beginning of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQSbms5MDvY">quantum mechanics</a>.

      These packets of light were eventually called <strong>photons</strong>.
      Photons have a frequency and a wavelength, but no mass.
      They are produced anytime a charged particle loses energy.
      Photons spread out propagating through space at the speed of light.
      They can transfer their energy to a charged particle in a process called absorption.
    </p>

    <h2 class='underlined' id="photo-electric">The Photoelectric Effect</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO38qVDGgqw">The photoelectric effect</a> occurs when metals dislodge electrons after being hit by light. Light with a frequency above the visible spectrum is required to produce the effect. Bright red light can't produce the effect, but even dim UV light can.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1905, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSgIDgGpRpk">Albert Einstein</a> published an explanation of the photoelectric effect that
      supported Max Plank's concept of quantized light. Einstein suggested that light is made up of many small packets of energy, and each packet interacts with a single electron.
      Only high frequency light releases electrons because it has enough energy per packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Einstein published an equation that describes the photoelectric effect using <a href="..\..\energy\conservation\index.html">conservation of energy</a>. The kinetic energy of a released electron can't exceed the difference between the energy of an incoming photon and the energy needed to dislodge the electron.
      If the maximum kinetic energy is below zero, an electron is not released.

      Electrons can be thought of as being stuck in a <a href="http://toutestquantique.fr/en/photoemission/">energy well</a>. The work function represents the minimum energy the electrons needs to escape.
      The work function depends on the material. Metals have a low work function, so it is easier to dislodge an electron from a metal.

      <strong>Question:</strong> Why does dim ultraviolet light produce the photoelectric effect, yet very bright red light doesn't?
      <details>
        <summary>answer</summary>
        <p>
          Most of the time just one photon is hitting one electron.
          Low energy photons don't have enough energy to dislodge an electron.
        </p>
        <p>
          A two photon photoelectric effect can happen, but it's probability is very low at normal light intensities.
          A high intensity red laser produces enough photons for a two photon effect, but it would also turn the metal into a hot plasma.

      <details>
        <summary>answer</summary>
        <p>
          Microwave ovens make microwaves. Each microwave photon has an energy around 10<sup>-23</sup> J. This is far below the ionization threshold: 1.60 × 10<sup>-18</sup> J.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many studies have been done on the risks of microwaves, but no adverse health effects have been <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_radiation_and_health'>established</a>. Microwaves can heat up
          things, but they will not directly cause <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven#Direct_microwave_exposure'>cell damage or cancer</a>. Cell Phones and Wi-Fi also use microwaves to transmit data.

      <details>
        <summary>answer</summary>
        <p>
          Too much sun can cause sunburns and skin cancer.
          Sunlight has some ionizing radiation in the UV part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
          Most of the UV is blocked by the ozone layer, but some still gets through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not enough sunlight is also unhealthy. A lack of Sun exposure can lead a vitamin D deficiency.
          It is recommended that we get at least 15 minutes of direct Sun every day.

          UV is less likely to ionize cells. Gamma-rays have much more energy per photon, but gamma-rays also have higher penetration. This means they can pass deeper into the body or not interact at all.

      Particles the size of a cat have extremely small wavelengths, but cats aren't exactly a single quantum particle.
      The equation begins to lose meaning at the macroscopic scale.
      This agrees with our everyday observations for cats. They don't have a measurable wave-nature, although they are very sneaky.

      <p>
        The nucleus of an atom attracts electrons because it has an opposite electric charge.
        This attraction can also lead to an orbit, but with some quantum mechanical restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quantum mechanics tells us that electrons can be described by a probability wave that represents the odds of finding an electron in a given state.
        As an electron tries to orbit the nucleus, the electron's probability wave destructively interferes with itself.
        This limits the wavelengths to values that allow constructive orbital <a href="..\waveproperties\index.html#standing-waves">standing waves</a> to form.
        We say that the allowed wavelengths are <a href="http://toutestquantique.fr/en/quantization/">quantized</a>.
        <strong>Quantizing</strong> means to restrict a variable to specific values.

        This simulation of a circular standing wave has some parallels to how electron orbitals form.
        The red and blue are possible clockwise and counterclockwise paths.
        For most wavelengths these paths interfere destructively, but at resonant wavelengths the paths interfere constructively to produce a standing wave.

        An analogy for atomic orbitals is the <a href="https://www.acs.psu.edu/drussell/Demos/MembraneCircle/Circle.html">vibrations of a drum</a>.

      <br>
      <p>
        In addition to quantizing the wavelength, there is another restriction.
        Two electrons can't form the exact same wave due to a quantum interaction called the Pauli exclusion principle.
        Four quantum numbers are used to describe the electron's wave.
        These numbers must be different for each electron.

        This image is a 2-D slice of the allowed 3-D <a href="http://toutestquantique.fr/en/atoms/">states</a> for electrons in a Hydrogen atom.
        Each electron in an atom or molecule must occupy a different wave state. This state determines its wavelength, frequency and energy.
      </p>
    </details>
    <br>
    <p>
      If an electron gains the energy difference between two states it can jump to a higher energy level.
      For example, an electron will transition to a higher energy level if it collides with a photon that has an energy equal to the energy difference between levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process can also run in reverse.
      An electron can drop to a lower energy level if an an atom has an unoccupied energy level.
      When the electron drops down it emits a photon equal to the difference in energy between each level.
      This follows the law of conservation of energy.

    Photon <strong>emission</strong> occurs when electrons transition to <strong>lower</strong> energy levels within an atom.
    Each electron transition emits a photon with an energy equal to the energy difference between levels.

    Hydrogen has a very simple emission spectrum because it doesn't have very many possible energy states and therefore few energy state transitions.

    Iron's nucleus has more protons so it has more possible energy transitions.
    <p>
      Photon emission is the working principle behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-discharge_lamp#Color">fluorescent lights</a>. To make light, a tube is filled with various gases. The gases are electrically charged up
      which brings the electrons to a higher energy level. The electrons are unstable in the higher energy levels. They eventually fall back down to their ground state and emit light. Try looking at fluorescent light reflected off a CD to see the separate <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kAB78NooguuwEKx62">bands of color</a>.
    </p>

    <div class='example'>
      <strong>Example:</strong> Find the frequency of the photon produced when an electron drops from an energy of -3.4 eV to -13.6 eV in a hydrogen atom?
      <details>
        <summary>solution</summary>
        $$\Delta E = -13.6 \, \mathrm{eV} + 3.4 \, \mathrm{eV}$$
        $$\Delta E = -10.2 \, \mathrm{eV} \left( \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J}}{1 \, \mathrm{eV}} \right) = 1.632 \times 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{J}$$
        <br>
        $$E = hf$$
        $$f = \frac{E}{h}$$
        $$f = \frac{ 1.632 \times 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{J}}{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \, s}}$$
        $$f = 2.46 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{Hz}$$
        <p>
          The photon is in the ultraviolet spectrum.

      <strong>Absorption</strong> is the reverse of emission. A single photon is absorbed by a single electron in a single atom.
      This causes the electron to transition to <strong>higher</strong> energy levels.
      <p>
        If there isn't an energy difference that matches the energy of the colliding photon, the material is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwRLIt6jgdM'>transparent</a> to that frequency. A substance may be clear in one range of the spectrum but not in others. For example: glass is mostly transparent to visible light, but it has many absorption frequencies in the infrared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exposing an atom to a full range of light will produce an absorption spectrum that matches the energy difference between electron energy levels.

      Light absorption occurs at the same energies as emission. Hydrogen's absorption frequencies are the same as its emission frequencies.

      <p>
        <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxC6F7bK8CU'>Analyzing the spectrum</a> of emission or absorption can actually be used like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line#Spectral_lines_of_chemical_elements">fingerprint</a> to identify the elements or molecules being observed. This technique is used in fields like forensics and astronomy.

      <strong>Question:</strong> What molecules are absorbing most of the Sun's infrared rays?
      <details>
        <summary>answer</summary>
        <p>H₂O, CO₂ and O₂ absorb infrared light and then re-emit the light in a random direction.</p>
        <p>High H₂O and CO₂ concentrations lead to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg">warmer</a> Earth. This happens because incoming sunlight is mostly visible and is not absorbed by these gases, but light leaving the Earth is mostly infrared and is absorbed.</p>

        This diagram shows the wavelengths of photons emitted or absorbed when an electron transitions between energy levels.
        Each wavelength, listed in nanometers, is for a photon with an energy equal to the difference between energy levels.
      </p>
      <strong>Question:</strong> What wavelength of light could make an electron jump from energy level n = 1 to n = 5?

        $$\lambda = 486 \, \mathrm{nm} = 4.86 \times 10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m}$$
        $$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
        $$E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^{8})}{4.86 \times 10^{-7}}$$
        $$E = 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} $$
        <br> $$E = 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J} \left(\frac{1 \, \mathrm{eV}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J}} \right) = 2.56 \, \mathrm{eV}$$

      <strong>Example:</strong> Find three possible light frequencies that could be absorbed by an electron at energy level n = 3.
      <details>
        <summary>solution</summary>
        <p>
          We can see three wavelengths in the diagram that transition to n = 3:
          <li>1875&nbsp;nm, &nbsp; 1282&nbsp;nm, &nbsp; 1094&nbsp;nm.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more transitions, but the diagram doesn't go past n = 6.
        </p>
        $$c=f \lambda$$
        $$f = \frac{c}{\lambda}$$
        $$f = \frac{3\times 10 ^8 }{\lambda}$$
        $$f = \frac{3\times 10 ^8 }{1875 \times 10^{-9}} \quad \frac{3\times 10 ^8 }{1282 \times 10^{-9}} \quad \frac{3\times 10 ^8 }{1094 \times 10^{-9}} $$
        $$f = 1.6 \times 10^{14} \,\,\,\quad 2.34 \times 10^{14} \,\,\,\quad 2.74 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz} $$
        <p>
          These frequencies are all in the infrared.
