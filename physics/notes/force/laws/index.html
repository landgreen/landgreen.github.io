			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UKGPOwR-iw">Isaac Newton</a>(1643-1727) made many profound contributions to science.
			He was an important figure in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution">Scientific Revolution</a>.
			He worked on optics.
			He discovered <a href="..\..\gravity\gravitation\index.html#universal-gravitation">universal gravitation</a>.
			He also shares credit for inventing calculus.
		</p>
		<p>
			In his work <em>Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>, Newton formulated his three laws of motion that model how objects accelerate.
			These <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgIm96-WkwY">laws</a> make up the foundation of classical physics.

			<summary>Hypothesis, Theory and Law</summary>
			<p>
				Science doesn't produce unchanging truths.
				Science is an ongoing process of discovery, and each new explanation has the potential to improve on the previous.
				Hypotheses, theories and laws could be true, but it is impossible to know anything with 100% certainty.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				A <strong>phenomenon</strong> is an observable event, like the orbits of planets, static electricity, and lactose intolerance.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a possible explanation for a phenomenon.
			</p>
			<p>
				A <strong>theory</strong> is a hypothesis that has been tested many times and never been proven false.
				Theories are explanations. They answer the question: why does this phenomenon occur?
				Examples include: quantum field theory, big bang theory, evolution, and germ theory.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				A <strong>scientific law</strong> is also based on the results of many tests, but a law doesn't explain why a phenomenon occurs.
				Instead, laws are a general description of what has happened and what will happen for a narrow range of conditions.
				<li>
					Laws predict the behavior of a natural phenomenon.
				</li>
				<li>
					Laws are only accurate for a limited range of conditions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Laws are typically a mathematical equation, or a rule.
				</li>
				<p>
					Almost all laws are found in the physical sciences.
					Some examples are: Ohm's Law, Universal Gravitation, Coulomb's law, and Kirchhoff's laws.
				</p>
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Question:</strong> Why are scientific laws so rare in the life sciences?
			<details>
				<summary>answer</summary>
				<p>
					Most biological phenomenon are too complex to be explained by math.
				</p>

			<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			<p>
				After observing the motion of the planets, Nicolaus Copernicus published the idea that the planets revolved around the sun.
				This idea was tested many times and never disproven.
				Sixty years later, Johannes Kepler discovered an equation that predicted how the planets moved around the sun.

			<strong>Question:</strong> Identify a phenomenon, hypothesis, theory, and law from the paragraph above.

			<strong>Question:</strong> What about a scientific model? What does that word mean?
			<details>
				<summary>answer</summary>
				<p>
					A <strong>scientific model</strong> is a simplified representation of an aspect of reality.
					Models help us learn new things, predict how a complex system behaves, or guide future research.
					Models in physics often take the form of an equation, but they can also be a set of rules, or a physical thing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally, it is clear that a model doesn't match reality, but if the inaccuracy is small a model still has value.

		<p class="quote">
			"A body either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force."
		</p>
		<div class="definition">
			All matter has the property of <strong>Inertia</strong>.
			Matter stays still or keeps moving until a force causes it to accelerate.
		</div>
		<p>
			Most people already have a strong intuitive understanding of inertia.
			You probably know it's difficult to move something very heavy and easy to move something light.
			That's inertia.

			Most people already have a strong intuitive understanding of inertia.
			Yet, obvious fundamental concepts like inertia are still important to state explicitly.

			<strong>Question:</strong> Objects on Earth seem to not follow Newton's first law. What causes objects on Earth to always come to a stop?
			<details>
				<summary>answer</summary>
				<p>
					The force of friction slows things down.
					As air particles strike a fast moving object the object slows down and the air speeds up.
					This spreads out the movement, but the movement is still there.
