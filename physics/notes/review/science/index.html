		<p>

			Thinking scientifically comes at a high cost that many people are willing to pay.
			That cost is learning to admit you are wrong.

		<h1 class='underlined'>Hypothesis, Theory, and Law</h1>
		<p>
			In science the words hypothesis, theory, and law have special meanings that don't exactly agree with how they are used outside of science.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hypotheses, theories and laws aren't facts.
			Science doesn't produce unchanging truths.
			Science is an ongoing process of discovery, and each new explanation has the potential to improve on the previous.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			A <strong>phenomenon</strong> is an observable event, like the orbits of planets, static electricity, and lactose intolerance.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <strong>hypothesis</strong> is a possible explanation for a phenomenon.
		</p>
		<p>
			A <strong>theory</strong> is a hypothesis that has been tested many times and never been proven false.
			Theories are explanations. They answer the question: why does this phenomenon occur?
			Examples include: quantum field theory, big bang theory, evolution, and germ theory.
		</p>
		<br>
		<div class="example-small">
			A <strong>scientific law</strong> is also based on the results of many tests, but a law doesn't explain why a phenomenon occurs.
			Instead, laws are a general description of what has happened and what will happen for a narrow range of conditions.
			<li>
				Laws predict the behavior of a natural phenomenon.
			</li>
			<li>
				Laws are only accurate for a limited range of conditions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Laws are typically a mathematical equation, or a rule.
			</li>
			<p>
				Almost all laws are found in the physical sciences.
				Some examples are: Ohm's Law, Universal Gravitation, Coulomb's law, and Kirchhoff's laws.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<strong>Question:</strong> Why are scientific laws so rare in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkR9hMCOIhM">life sciences</a>?
			<details>
				<summary>answer</summary>
				<p>
					Most biological phenomenon are too complex to be explained by math.
				</p>
			</details>
		</div>

		<div class="example">
			<p>
				After observing the motion of the planets, Nicolaus Copernicus published the idea that the planets revolved around the sun.
				This idea was tested many times and never disproven.
				Sixty year later, Johannes Kepler discovered an equation that predicted how the planets moved around the sun.
			</p>
			<strong>Question:</strong> Identify a phenomenon, hypothesis, theory, and law from the paragraph above.
			<details>
				<summary>answer</summary>
				<p>
					<strong>phenomenon</strong>: the motion of the planets
					<br><strong>hypothesis</strong>: planets revolve around the sun
					<br><strong>theory</strong>: planets revolve around the sun
					<br><strong>law</strong>: Kepler's equation

		<h1 class='underlined'>Probability and Truth</h1>
		<p>
			value of Bayesian probability (no true and false, only % chance to be true)
		</p>
		<p>
			scientists shouldn't say they believe in things 100%, things have a probability or being true or not
		</p>

			Is there an elephant less than 100m away from you right now?

		<h1 class='underlined'>Human Biases</h1>
		<p>
			science as a progression away from human biases
		</p>
		<p>
			self centered: the universe is centered around me > Earth > Sun > there is no center
			<br> relativity: velocity only exists relative to something
		</p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Perception and Reality</h1>
		<p>
			real things, we can't directly sense: E-M spectrum, subatomic particles, gravity fields, electric fields, electricity
		</p>
		<p>sensory illusions: why does metal feel cold, optical illusions,
		</p>
		<p>delusions: some people believe things that are in their mind exist outside their mind (ghosts)
		</p>
		<p>
			"Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."
			<br>- Philip K. Dick
		</p>

		<h1 class='underlined'>Modeling of Reality</h1>
		<p>
			Science builds models to explain an aspect of reality. Most models are only accurate within a range of conditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Newtonian physics is a model that explains how things move, but it isn't a perfect description of reality.
			Relativistic physics is a more accurate model of reality near the speed of light, and quantum mechanics is more accurate for very short distances.
			No current scientific model can describe our universe perfectly.
