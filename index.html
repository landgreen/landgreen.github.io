            Physics is a lab science with a math focus.
            We use physical relationships to predict and shape our surroundings.
            We will also attempt to discover new physical relationships through experimentation.

            <summary>About Physics</summary>
            <p>
                <strong>Physics is science.</strong> Physicists build mathematical models that approximate how matter and energy change over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Physics advances technology.</strong> Physics explains how electromagnetic waves encode information from a cell phone, how electricity in a computer chip is controlled by transistors, how a speaker produces sound with magnets, and how GPS calculates position.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Physics guides engineering.</strong> A knowledge of physics allows engineers to predict how their projects will behave. Physics helps them design, tinker, and experiment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Physics speaks with math.</strong> Math is the language physics uses to understand and communicate the nature of our universe.

                An organized notebook/binder and a scientific calculator is required. I'm flexible about most other details, but I recommend:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>graph paper:</strong> for graphing, charts, free body diagrams, circuit diagrams, ...
                <br> <strong>scientific calculator:</strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-Scientific-Calculator-Accents/dp/B00000JBNX?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0">TI-30XIIS</a> is cheap and works well.
                <br> <strong>pen or pencil:</strong> I like <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00092RJX0/_encoding=UTF8?coliid=I17A6WSIFV5AG6&colid=26R4C03G1WG78'>these</a> colored pens.
                <br> <strong>highlighter</strong>

            This class focuses on learning computer science through projects.
            We build browser based projects using JavaScript.
            We also build Arduino based projects for simple electric circuits.
